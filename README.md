## **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About paCSEmaker**  
paCEmaker is a project done from UNIST 2023 CSE364 Software Endineering course.  

This web application originated from needs of the university life planner.  

In UNIST portal, it is hard to plan 4-year course taking roadmap right away.  

Also, it takes additional step to view which courses has the professor opened.  

And there is no gathered data about CSE professors, so we need to visit another website.  

To resolve this, our team made integrated UNIST CSE planner called **paCSEmaker**.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started**  
### *Case 1:* For ordinary users who want to use our product  
First, you need two files to start deloying. If you're missing with any one of these, please get them from our github repository.
* Dockerfile  
* CSE364_project.war
* run.sh

If you have two files on the same directory, make a Docker image by typing this command.  
```bash
docker build -t pacsemaker .
```
Then, you can see the Docker image has been created. Now, make a new container with port 8080.  
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it pacsemaker
```
After this process, wait for 2~3 minutes. Then you can start using our product on <http://localhost:8080>.  
### *Case 2:* For developers who want to view&edit our code  
For this case, you need three files to start deloying. Again, missing files can be obtained from our github repository.
* Dockerfile  
* CSE364_project.war
* run.sh

**Important!** You need to do a modification on Dockerfile. Please change the following parts as follows.  
```bash
//Change line 42 from  
CMD mongod --fork --logpath /var/log/mongodb.log; /root/tomcat/apache-tomcat-10.0.10/bin/catalina.sh run  
//into  
CMD mongod  
```
Then, make a Docker image on the directory that three files are put together.  
```bash
docker build -t pacsemaker .
```
After creating Docker image, make a new container with port 8080.  
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -it pacsemaker
```
Execute that container with this command.  
```bash
docker exec -it container_name /bin/bash
```
Finally, inside the docker container, run the following command.  
```bash
bash run.sh
```
With 3~4 minutes of waitings, you can view our product on <http://localhost:8080>.  
Please refer to [Milestone2 README](https://github.com/changuniuni/2023-CSE364-SE-Group7/blob/milestone2/README.md) to see how to manipulate REST APIs.
