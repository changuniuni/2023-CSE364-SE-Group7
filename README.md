## **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About paCSEmaker**  
paCEmaker is a project done from UNIST 2023 CSE364 Software Endineering course.  

This web application originated from needs of the university life planner.  

In UNIST portal, it is hard to plan 4-year course taking roadmap right away.  

Also, it takes additional step to view which courses has the professor opened.  

And there is no gathered data about CSE professors, so we need to visit another website.  

To resolve this, our team made integrated UNIST CSE planner called **paCSEmaker**.
